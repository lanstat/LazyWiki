He occasionally worked as a producer and director.\n\nAccording to Lluis Fàbregas Cuixart,{{efn|1 = Luis Fábregas y Cuxart (Palma 1906–1979) was a fairly well-known Mallorcan author}} the pseudonym \'\'Fortunio Bonanova\'\' referred to his desire to seek fortune, and his love of the Bonanova neighborhood in his native [[Palma de Mallorca]].\n\n== Biography ==\nAs a young man, living under his birthname, he was a professional [[telegraph]] operator. He studied [[music]] with the [[Italy|Italian]] Giovachini. In 1921, he debuted as a singer in \'\'[[Tannhäuser (Wagner)|Tannhäuser]]\'\', at the Teatre Principal in Palma. That year, along with a group of [[Majorca]]n intellectuals and [[Jorge Luis Borges]] (who was briefly living in Majorca with his parents and sister), he signed the Ultraist Manifesto, using the name Fortunio Bonanova.\n\nAlso in 1921, he appeared in a silent film of \'\'[[Don Juan Tenorio]]\'\' by the brothers Baños, which was shown the following year in [[New York City]] and [[Hollywood]]. He later directed his own \'\'Don Juan\'\' in 1924.\n\nIn 1927, he acted in \'\'Love of Sonya\'\', directed by [[Albert Parker (director)|Albert Parker]] and starring [[Gloria Swanson]]. In 1932 he had small parts in Hollywood productions featuring [[Joan Bennett]] and [[Mary Astor]]. In the same period, he appeared in New York in several [[opera]]s as well as the  [[zarzuela]]s \'\'La Canción del Olvido\'\' ("The song of forgetting"), \'\'La Duquesa del Tabarín\'\' ("The Duchess of Tabarín"), \'\'Los Gavilanes\'\', and \'\'La Montería\'\'. In 1934, he returned to [[Spain]], where he had a major role in the film \'\'El Desaparecido\'\' ("The disappeared one") written and directed by Antonio Graciani. In 1935 he acted and sang in the film \'\'Poderoso Caballero\'\' ("A Big Guy"), directed by Màximo Nossik.\n\nIn 1936, with the outbreak of the [[Spanish Civil War]], he returned to the United States, where he played the role of Captain Bill in a film called \'\'Capitán Tormenta\'\', directed by Jules Bernhardt. A sequence of increasingly larger acting and singing roles mostly in English-language films followed, especially after 1940. Among his roles were Signor Matiste, Susan Alexander Kane\'s opera coach in \'\'[[Citizen Kane]]\'\' (1941); General Sebastiano in \'\'[[Five Graves to Cairo]]\'\' (1943); Don Miguel in \'\'[[The Black Swan (film)|The Black Swan]]\'\' (1942); Fernando in \'\'[[For Whom the Bell Tolls (film)|For Whom the Bell Tolls]]\'\' (1943); Sam Garlopis in \'\'[[Double Indemnity (film)|Double Indemnity]]\'\' (1944);<ref>{{AFI film|2201|Double Indemnity}}</ref> and a singing [[Christopher Columbus]] in \'\'[[Where Do We Go From Here? (movie)|Where Do We Go From Here?]]\'\'. He continued for the next several decades in a miscellany of character roles.\n\nBonanova was also an uncredited technical consultant for the film \'\'[[Blood and Sand (1941 film)|Blood and Sand]]\'\' (1941), and produced and appeared in the Spanish-language film \'\'La Inmaculada\'\' (a name of the [[Blessed Virgin Mary|Virgin Mary]], "Immaculate")(1939).\n\nBonanova played the father of twins [[Esther Williams]], and [[Ricardo Montalbán]] in the 1947 film \'\'[[Fiesta (1947 film)|Fiesta]]\'\'.  In 1949, Bonanova collaborated with Ambrose Barker (a former music hall performer who had, with his partner/wife, Peggy Wynne, had some success on the British colonial circuit in the 1920s–1930s) on a musical entitled "Glamor/Glamour is the Gimmick." It got bad reviews—what may have been popular and witty in the early 1930s didn’t make it in 1949.<ref>Billboard, 22 October 1949, pg. 24</ref>\n\nIn the 1950s, he appeared in an episode of \'\'[[I Love Lucy]]\'\' as a fake psychic who uses his stage apparatus to make it appear as though Lucy is able to speak Spanish to her mother-in-law.\n\nIn 1953 he played [[Lou Costello]]\'s Uncle Bozzo in the [[Abbott & Costello]] episode of "Uncle Bozzo\'s Visit."\n\nBonanova died in 1969 in [[Woodland, California]] of a [[cerebral hemorrhage]] and is buried at [[Holy Cross Cemetery, Culver City|Holy Cross Cemetery]] in [[Culver City, California]].\n\n==Partial filmography==\n{{Div col|cols=2}}\n* \'\'[[Careless Lady]]\'\' (1932)\n* \'\'[[A Successful Calamity]]\'\' (1932)\n* \'\'[[Captain Calamity (film)#Spanish version|El capitan Tormenta]]\'\' (1936)\n* \'\'[[I Was an Adventuress]]\'\' (1940)\n* \'\'[[Down Argentine Way]]\'\' (1940)\n* \'\'[[The Mark of Zorro (1940 film)|The Mark of Zorro]]\'\' (1940) (uncredited)\n* \'\'[[Citizen Kane]]\'\' (1941)\n* \'\'[[Moon Over Miami (film)|Moon Over Miami]]\'\' (1941)\n* \'\'[[Blood and Sand (1941 film)|Blood and Sand]]\'\' (1941)\n* \'\'[[A Yank in the R.A.F.]]\'\' (1941)\n* \'\'[[Mr. and Mrs. North (film)|Mr. and Mrs. North]]\'\' (1942)\n* \'\'[[Obliging Young Lady]]\'\' (1942)\n* \'\'[[Larceny, Inc.]]\'\' (1942)\n* \'\'[[Girl Trouble (1942 film)|Girl Trouble]]\'\' (1942)\n* \'\'[[The Black Swan (film)|The Black Swan]]\'\' (1942) (uncredited)\n* \'\'[[Five Graves to Cairo]]\'\' (1943)\n* \'\'[[Dixie (film)|Dixie]]\'\' (1943)\n* \'\'[[For Whom the Bell Tolls (film)|For Whom the Bell Tolls]]\'\' (1943)\n* \'\'[[Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves (1944 film)|Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves]]\'\' (1944)\n* \'\'[[My Best Gal]]\'\' (1944)\n* \'\'[[Double Indemnity (film)|Double Indemnity]]\'\' (1944)\n* \'\'[[Going My Way]]\'\' (1944)\n* \'\'[[Mrs. Parkington]]\'\' (1944)\n* \'\'[[Brazil (1944 film)|Brazil]]\'\' (1944)\n* \'\'[[Where Do We Go from Here?

The JavaScript components complement [[Apache Cordova|PhoneGap]], the framework used for developing cross-platform mobile apps. It aims to simplify both the development and the [[software testing|testing]] of such applications by providing a framework for client-side [[model–view–controller]] (MVC) and [[Model View ViewModel|model–view–viewmodel]] (MVVM) architectures, along with components commonly used in [[rich Internet application]]s.\n\nThe AngularJS framework works by first reading the [[HTML]] page, which has embedded into it additional custom [[HTML attribute|tag attributes]]. Angular interprets those attributes as [[Directive (programming)|directives]] to bind input or output parts of the page to a model that is represented by standard [[JavaScript]] [[Variable (computer science)|variables]]. The values of those JavaScript variables can be manually set within the code, or retrieved from static or dynamic [[JSON]] resources.\n\nAccording to [[JavaScript]] analytics service [[Libscore]], AngularJS is used on the websites of [[Wolfram Alpha]], [[NBC]], [[Walgreens]], [[Intel]], [[Sprint Nextel|Sprint]], [[ABC News]], and approximately 8,400 other sites out of 1 million tested in July 2015.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://libscore.com/?#angular|title=Libscore|website=libscore.com|access-date=2016-07-13}}</ref>\n\nAngularJS is the frontend part of the [[MEAN (software bundle)|MEAN stack]], consisting of [[MongoDB|\'\'\'M\'\'\'ongoDB]] database, [[Express.js|\'\'\'E\'\'\'xpress.js]] web application server framework, \'\'\'A\'\'\'ngular.js itself, and [[Node.js|\'\'\'N\'\'\'ode.js]] runtime environment.\n\n==Angular JS==\nAngularJS is built on the belief that [[declarative programming]] should be used to create [[user interface]]s and connect [[software component]]s, while [[imperative programming]] is better suited to defining an application\'s [[business logic]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://docs.angularjs.org/guide/introduction |title=What Is Angular? |deadurl=no |accessdate=12 February 2013}}</ref> The framework adapts and extends traditional HTML to present dynamic content through two-way data-binding that allows for the automatic synchronization of models and views. As a result, AngularJS de-emphasizes explicit DOM manipulation with the goal of improving testability and performance.\n\nAngularJS\'s design goals include:\n*to decouple [[Document Object Model|DOM]] manipulation from application logic. The difficulty of this is dramatically affected by the way the code is structured.\n*to decouple the client side of an application from the server side. This allows development work to progress in parallel, and allows for reuse of both sides.\n*to provide structure for the journey of building an application: from designing the UI, through writing the business logic, to testing.\n\nAngular implements the MVC pattern to separate presentation, data, and logic components. Using [[dependency injection]], Angular brings traditionally [[server-side]] services, such as view-dependent controllers, to client-side web applications. Consequently, much of the burden on the server can be reduced.\n\n==Scope==\nAngular uses the term "scope" in a manner akin to the fundamentals of computer science.\n\n[[Scope (computer science)|Scope]] in computer science describes when in the program a particular [[Name binding|binding]] is valid. The [[ECMA-262]] specification defines scope as: a lexical environment in which a Function object is executed in client-side web scripts;<ref name=es5-x10.2>{{cite web|title=Annotated ECMAScript 5.1, Section 10.2 Lexical Environments|url=https://es5.github.io/#x10.2|accessdate=2015-01-03}}</ref> akin to how scope is defined in [[lambda calculus]].<ref name="BarendregtBarendsen">{{Citation\n  | last = Barendregt\n  | first = Henk\n  | author-link =\n  | last2 = Barendsen\n  | first2 = Erik\n  | author2-link =\n  | title = Introduction to Lambda Calculus\n  | place =\n  | publisher =\n  | year = March 2000\n  | volume =\n  | edition =\n  | url = ftp://ftp.cs.ru.nl/pub/CompMath.Found/lambda.pdf\n  | doi =\n  | id =\n  | isbn = }}</ref>\n\nAs a part of the "MVC" architecture, the scope forms the "Model", and all variables defined in the scope can be accessed by the "View" as well as the "Controller". The scope behaves as a glue and binds the "View" and the "Controller".\n\nIn Angular, "scope" is a certain kind of [[Object (computer science)|object]]<ref name=angular-scope>{{cite web|title=AngularJS: Developer Guide: Scopes|url=https://docs.angularjs.org/guide/scope|accessdate=2015-01-03}}</ref> that itself can be in scope or out of scope in any given part of the program, following the [[Scope (computer science)#JavaScript|usual rules]] of [[Variable (computer science)#Scope and extent|variable scope]] in JavaScript like any other object.<ref name=ecmascript-scope>{{cite web|title=ECMA-262-3 in detail.

Some of the most commonly used directives are:\n\n;ng-app: Declares the root element of an AngularJS application, under which directives can be used to declare bindings and define behavior.\n;ng-bind: Sets the text of a DOM element to the value of an expression. For example, <code><nowiki><span ng-bind="name"></span></nowiki></code> displays the value of ‘name’ inside the span element. Any change to the variable ‘name’ in the application\'s scope reflect instantly in the DOM.\n;ng-model: Similar to ng-bind, but establishes a two-way data binding between the view and the scope.\n;ng-model-options: Provides tuning for how model updates are done.\n;ng-class: Lets class attributes be dynamically loaded.\n;ng-controller: Specifies a JavaScript controller class that evaluates HTML expressions.\n;ng-repeat: Instantiate an element once per item from a collection.\n;ng-show & ng-hide: Conditionally show or hide an element, depending on the value of a boolean expression. Show and hide is achieved by setting the CSS display style.\n;ng-switch: Conditionally instantiate one template from a set of choices, depending on the value of a selection expression.\n;ng-view: The base directive responsible for handling routes that resolve JSON before rendering templates driven by specified controllers.\n;ng-if: Basic if statement directive that allow to show the following element if the conditions are true. When the condition is false, the element is removed from the DOM. When true, a clone of the compiled element is re-inserted\n;ng-aria: A module for accessibility support of common [[WAI-ARIA|ARIA attributes]].\n;ng-animate: A module provides support for JavaScript, CSS3 transition and CSS3 keyframe animation hooks within existing core and custom directives.\n\nSince \'\'\'ng-*\'\'\' attributes are not valid in HTML specifications, \'\'\'data-ng-*\'\'\' can also be used as a prefix. For example, both \'\'\'ng-app\'\'\' and \'\'\'data-ng-app\'\'\' are valid in AngularJS.\n\n==Two-way data binding==\nAngularJS\' two-way [[data binding]] is its most notable feature,<ref>{{cite web|title=AngularJS Features|url=http://angularjsfeatures.blogspot.in/2016/06/top-10-websites-built-using-angularjs.html}}</ref> largely relieving the server backend of templating responsibilities. Instead, templates are rendered in plain HTML according to data contained in a scope defined in the model. The <code>$scope</code> service in Angular detects changes to the model section and modifies HTML expressions in the view via a controller. Likewise, any alterations to the view are reflected in the model. This circumvents the need to actively manipulate the DOM and encourages bootstrapping and rapid prototyping of web applications.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/javascript-ajax/5-awesome-angularjs-features/ |title=5 Awesome AngularJS Features |deadurl=no |accessdate=13 February 2013}}</ref>\nAngularJS detects changes in models by comparing the current values with values stored earlier in a process of dirty-checking, unlike [[Ember.js]] and [[Backbone.js]] that trigger listeners when the model values are changed.<ref name="Misko Hevery">{{cite web | title = Databinding in angularjs | author = Misko Hevery | url = https://stackoverflow.com/a/9693933/146423 | accessdate= 2014-03-09 }}</ref>\n\n==Development history==\nAngularJS was originally developed in 2009 by Miško Hevery<ref name=angularishere>{{cite web|title=Hello World, <angular/> is here|url=http://misko.hevery.com/2009/09/28/hello-world-angular-is-here/|accessdate=2014-10-12}}</ref> at Brat Tech LLC<ref name=getangular-archive.org>{{cite web|title=GetAngular|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100413141437/http://getangular.com/ |archive-date=2010-04-13 |url=http://getangular.com/ |deadurl=yes |publisher=Angular / BRAT Tech.

This venture was located at the web domain "GetAngular.com",<ref name="getangular-archive.org"/> and had a few subscribers, before the two decided to abandon the business idea and release Angular as an open-source library.\n\n===Releases===\n\n====Angular 1====\nThe current stable release of AngularJS is 1.5.7.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://github.com/angular/angular.js/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#157-hexagonal-circumvolution-2016-06-15|title=angular/angular.js|website=GitHub|access-date=2016-07-13}}</ref>\n\n====Angular 2====\nAngularJS 2.0 was announced at the ng-Europe conference 22-23.

Angular 2 moved to Beta in December 2015,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://angularjs.blogspot.it/2015/12/angular-2-beta.html|title=Angular: Angular 2 Beta|website=angularjs.blogspot.it|access-date=2016-07-13}}</ref> and the first release candidate was published in May 2016.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#200-rc0-2016-05-02|title=angular/angular|website=GitHub|access-date=2016-05-04}}</ref>\n\nAngular 2 is not a version upgrade, but a complete rewrite.  The primary differences in Angular 2 over Angular 1 are:<ref>[http://bindasmonkeys.com/7-key-differences-angular-1-angular-2-code-examples/ "7 key differences between Angular 1 and Angular 2"]</ref>\n* Mobile development - desktop development is much easier when mobile performance issues are handled first\n* Modularity - much core functionality has moved to modules, producing a lighter, faster core\n* Modern browsers only - reducing the need for [[Cross-browser|browser compatibility]] workarounds\n* Angular 2 recommends the use of Microsoft\'s [[TypeScript]] language, which introduces the following improvements:\n** Class-based [[Object-oriented programming|Object Oriented Programming]]\n** [[Static typing|Static Typing]]\n** [[Generic programming|Generics]]\n** [[Lambda (programming)|Lambdas]]\n* TypeScript is a superset of ECMAScript 6, and is [[Backward compatibility|backwards compatible]] with ECMAScript 5 (i.e.: JavaScript).  Angular 2 also includes the benefits of [[ES6]]:\n** Iterators\n** For/Of Loops\n** Python-Style Generators\n** [[Reflection (programming)|Reflection]]\n* Improved [[Dependency injection|Dependency Injection]] - bindings make it possible for dependencies to be named\n* [[Dynamic loading|Dynamic Loading]]\n* Asynchronous Template Compilation\n* Simpler Routing\n* Diary.js Logging - measures where time is spent, to identify bottlenecks<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.sitepoint.com/whats-new-in-angularjs-2/|title=What\'s New in AngularJS 2.0|date=2015-03-02|website=SitePoint|language=en-US|access-date=2016-05-04}}</ref>\n* Replacing controllers and $scope with components and directives.  (A component is a directive with a template.)\n\n===Legacy browser support===\nVersions 1.2 and later of AngularJS do not support [[Internet Explorer]] versions 6 or 7.<ref name=angularjs-ie-compat>{{cite web|title=AngularJS: Developer Guide: Internet Explorer Compatibility|url=https://docs.angularjs.org/guide/ie|publisher=Google|accessdate=2014-10-12}}</ref> Versions 1.3 and later of AngularJS dropped support for Internet Explorer 8.<ref name=angularjs-13>{{cite web|last1=Minar|first1=Igor|title=AngularJS 1.3: a new release approaches|url=http://angularjs.blogspot.com/2013/12/angularjs-13-new-release-approaches.html|website=AngularJS Blog|accessdate=2014-10-12}}</ref>\n\n==Chrome plugin==\nIn July 2012, the Angular team built a plugin for the [[Google Chrome]] browser called Batarang,<ref name=batarang-github>{{cite web|title=angular/angularjs-batarang (GitHub)|url=https://github.com/angular/angularjs-batarang|accessdate=2014-10-12}}</ref> that improves the debugging experience for web applications built with Angular.

This cycle can be considered a loop, during which AngularJS checks if there is any change to all the variables watched by all the <code>$scopes</code>. So, if <code>$scope.myVar</code> is defined in a controller and this variable was marked for watching, AngularJS will monitor the changes on myVar in each loop iteration.\n\nThis approach potentially leads to slow rendering when AngularJS checks on too many variables in the <code>$scope</code> every cycle. Hevery suggests keeping fewer than 2000 watchers on any page.<ref name="Misko Hevery"/>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Free software}}\n* [[Backbone.js]]\n* [[Ember.js]]\n* [[Knockout.js]]\n* [[MEAN (software bundle)]]\n* [[React.js]]\n* [[Comparison of JavaScript frameworks]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{refbegin}}\n*{{cite book\n| first1      = Brad\n| last1       = Green\n| first2      = Shyam\n| last2       = Seshadri\n| date        = March 22, 2013\n| title       = AngularJS\n| publisher   = [[O\'Reilly Media]]\n| edition     = 1st\n| page        = 150\n| isbn        = 978-1449344856\n| url         = http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920028055.do\n}}\n*{{cite book\n| first1      = Pawel\n| last1       = Kozlowski\n| first2      = Peter Bacon\n| last2       = Darwin\n| date        = August 23, 2013\n| title       = Mastering Web Application Development with AngularJS\n| publisher   = [[Packt Publishing]]\n| edition     = 1st\n| page        = 372\n| isbn        = 978-1782161820\n| url         = https://www.packtpub.com/angularjs-web-application-development/book\n}}\n*{{cite book\n| first1      = Lukas\n| last1       = Ruebbelke\n| date        = January 1, 2015\n| title       = AngularJS in Action\n| publisher   = [[Manning Publications]]\n| edition     = 1st\n| page        = 325\n| isbn        = 978-1617291333\n| url         = \n}}\n{{refend}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|AngularJS}}\n* [https://www.angularjs.org/ Official website (original)]\n* [https://angular.io/ Official website]\n<!-- *{{Vimeo|id=43922554|title=Digesting JavaScript MVC}} -->{{JS templating |state=autocollapse}}\n{{Rich Internet applications}}\n{{Application frameworks}}\n{{ECMAScript}}\n{{NodeJs}}\n\n[[Category:Ajax (programming)]]\n[[Category:Google software]]\n[[Category:Rich Internet application frameworks]]\n[[Category:Software using the MIT license]]'}}};
