He occasionally worked as a producer and director.\n\nAccording to Lluis Fàbregas Cuixart,{{efn|1 = Luis Fábregas y Cuxart (Palma 1906–1979) was a fairly well-known Mallorcan author}} the pseudonym \'\'Fortunio Bonanova\'\' referred to his desire to seek fortune, and his love of the Bonanova neighborhood in his native [[Palma de Mallorca]].\n\n== Biography ==\nAs a young man, living under his birthname, he was a professional [[telegraph]] operator. He studied [[music]] with the [[Italy|Italian]] Giovachini. In 1921, he debuted as a singer in \'\'[[Tannhäuser (Wagner)|Tannhäuser]]\'\', at the Teatre Principal in Palma. That year, along with a group of [[Majorca]]n intellectuals and [[Jorge Luis Borges]] (who was briefly living in Majorca with his parents and sister), he signed the Ultraist Manifesto, using the name Fortunio Bonanova.\n\nAlso in 1921, he appeared in a silent film of \'\'[[Don Juan Tenorio]]\'\' by the brothers Baños, which was shown the following year in [[New York City]] and [[Hollywood]]. He later directed his own \'\'Don Juan\'\' in 1924.\n\nIn 1927, he acted in \'\'Love of Sonya\'\', directed by [[Albert Parker (director)|Albert Parker]] and starring [[Gloria Swanson]]. In 1932 he had small parts in Hollywood productions featuring [[Joan Bennett]] and [[Mary Astor]]. In the same period, he appeared in New York in several [[opera]]s as well as the  [[zarzuela]]s \'\'La Canción del Olvido\'\' ("The song of forgetting"), \'\'La Duquesa del Tabarín\'\' ("The Duchess of Tabarín"), \'\'Los Gavilanes\'\', and \'\'La Montería\'\'. In 1934, he returned to [[Spain]], where he had a major role in the film \'\'El Desaparecido\'\' ("The disappeared one") written and directed by Antonio Graciani. In 1935 he acted and sang in the film \'\'Poderoso Caballero\'\' ("A Big Guy"), directed by Màximo Nossik.\n\nIn 1936, with the outbreak of the [[Spanish Civil War]], he returned to the United States, where he played the role of Captain Bill in a film called \'\'Capitán Tormenta\'\', directed by Jules Bernhardt. A sequence of increasingly larger acting and singing roles mostly in English-language films followed, especially after 1940. Among his roles were Signor Matiste, Susan Alexander Kane\'s opera coach in \'\'[[Citizen Kane]]\'\' (1941); General Sebastiano in \'\'[[Five Graves to Cairo]]\'\' (1943); Don Miguel in \'\'[[The Black Swan (film)|The Black Swan]]\'\' (1942); Fernando in \'\'[[For Whom the Bell Tolls (film)|For Whom the Bell Tolls]]\'\' (1943); Sam Garlopis in \'\'[[Double Indemnity (film)|Double Indemnity]]\'\' (1944);<ref>{{AFI film|2201|Double Indemnity}}</ref> and a singing [[Christopher Columbus]] in \'\'[[Where Do We Go From Here? (movie)|Where Do We Go From Here?]]\'\'. He continued for the next several decades in a miscellany of character roles.\n\nBonanova was also an uncredited technical consultant for the film \'\'[[Blood and Sand (1941 film)|Blood and Sand]]\'\' (1941), and produced and appeared in the Spanish-language film \'\'La Inmaculada\'\' (a name of the [[Blessed Virgin Mary|Virgin Mary]], "Immaculate")(1939).\n\nBonanova played the father of twins [[Esther Williams]], and [[Ricardo Montalbán]] in the 1947 film \'\'[[Fiesta (1947 film)|Fiesta]]\'\'.  In 1949, Bonanova collaborated with Ambrose Barker (a former music hall performer who had, with his partner/wife, Peggy Wynne, had some success on the British colonial circuit in the 1920s–1930s) on a musical entitled "Glamor/Glamour is the Gimmick." It got bad reviews—what may have been popular and witty in the early 1930s didn’t make it in 1949.<ref>Billboard, 22 October 1949, pg. 24</ref>\n\nIn the 1950s, he appeared in an episode of \'\'[[I Love Lucy]]\'\' as a fake psychic who uses his stage apparatus to make it appear as though Lucy is able to speak Spanish to her mother-in-law.\n\nIn 1953 he played [[Lou Costello]]\'s Uncle Bozzo in the [[Abbott & Costello]] episode of "Uncle Bozzo\'s Visit."\n\nBonanova died in 1969 in [[Woodland, California]] of a [[cerebral hemorrhage]] and is buried at [[Holy Cross Cemetery, Culver City|Holy Cross Cemetery]] in [[Culver City, California]].\n\n==Partial filmography==\n{{Div col|cols=2}}\n* \'\'[[Careless Lady]]\'\' (1932)\n* \'\'[[A Successful Calamity]]\'\' (1932)\n* \'\'[[Captain Calamity (film)#Spanish version|El capitan Tormenta]]\'\' (1936)\n* \'\'[[I Was an Adventuress]]\'\' (1940)\n* \'\'[[Down Argentine Way]]\'\' (1940)\n* \'\'[[The Mark of Zorro (1940 film)|The Mark of Zorro]]\'\' (1940) (uncredited)\n* \'\'[[Citizen Kane]]\'\' (1941)\n* \'\'[[Moon Over Miami (film)|Moon Over Miami]]\'\' (1941)\n* \'\'[[Blood and Sand (1941 film)|Blood and Sand]]\'\' (1941)\n* \'\'[[A Yank in the R.A.F.]]\'\' (1941)\n* \'\'[[Mr. and Mrs. North (film)|Mr. and Mrs. North]]\'\' (1942)\n* \'\'[[Obliging Young Lady]]\'\' (1942)\n* \'\'[[Larceny, Inc.]]\'\' (1942)\n* \'\'[[Girl Trouble (1942 film)|Girl Trouble]]\'\' (1942)\n* \'\'[[The Black Swan (film)|The Black Swan]]\'\' (1942) (uncredited)\n* \'\'[[Five Graves to Cairo]]\'\' (1943)\n* \'\'[[Dixie (film)|Dixie]]\'\' (1943)\n* \'\'[[For Whom the Bell Tolls (film)|For Whom the Bell Tolls]]\'\' (1943)\n* \'\'[[Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves (1944 film)|Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves]]\'\' (1944)\n* \'\'[[My Best Gal]]\'\' (1944)\n* \'\'[[Double Indemnity (film)|Double Indemnity]]\'\' (1944)\n* \'\'[[Going My Way]]\'\' (1944)\n* \'\'[[Mrs. Parkington]]\'\' (1944)\n* \'\'[[Brazil (1944 film)|Brazil]]\'\' (1944)\n* \'\'[[Where Do We Go from Here?
